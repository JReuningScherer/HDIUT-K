*How Do I Use This -- Keyboard* 

*I just need a piano sound!*

*Why canâ€™t I see the screen?*

Are these question you (or some one near) has been asking? Is your keyboard way too complicated? Did you scan a random QR code on the side of a keyboard? 

If so, these files may be useful to you!

## How this works 
This repository contains information on how to use a Yamaha MOTIF XS7, including  
- general operating instructions
- some nice patches you can try 
- manuals and datasheets (nerd stuff) 
- emergency guidance on how to fix an unknown problem 3 minutes before performing  

## About these files
